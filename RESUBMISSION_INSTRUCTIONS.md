## 🚀 Resubmission Steps

### Option 1: Quick Resubmission (5 Fixed Questions)

Resubmit only the questions that were graded (had issues):

1. **Question 1** - Upload: `coursera_submission/Question_1/AI-capstone-M1L1-v1.ipynb`
2. **Question 2** - Upload: `coursera_submission/Question_2/AI-capstone-M1L2-v1.ipynb`
3. **Question 3** - Upload: `coursera_submission/Question_3/AI-capstone-M1L3-v1.ipynb`
4. **Question 4** - Upload: `coursera_submission/Question_4/Lab-M2L1-...-v1.ipynb`
5. **Question 6** - Upload: `coursera_submission/Question_6/Lab-M2L3-...-v1.ipynb`

### Option 2: Full Resubmission (All 9 Questions)

If Coursera allows, submit all 9 questions:

1. Go to `coursera_submission/` folder
2. Upload each Question_X folder's .ipynb file to corresponding question
3. Verify all uploads complete

## 📝 Key Changes Summary

### What Grader Wanted:
1. **Individual cells, not large combined cells**
2. **Executed code with visible outputs**
3. **No syntax errors**
4. **Proper cell execution order**

### What We Fixed:
1. ✓ Split all large solution cells into individual task cells
2. ✓ Removed all syntax errors (stray quotes, formatting issues)
3. ✓ Executed all cells to produce outputs
4. ✓ Un-commented solution code so it runs
5. ✓ Added explicit calculations (like false-negative count)
6. ✓ Ensured proper import order and dependencies

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Upload .ipynb files** - NOT .py files (you did this correctly last time based on grader feedback)
2. **Files have outputs** - All fixed notebooks now have executed cells with visible outputs
3. **No more syntax errors** - All large problematic cells have been split
4. **Proper execution order** - Cells execute sequentially without NameErrors
